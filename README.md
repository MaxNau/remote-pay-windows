# Clover SDK for Windows PoS Integration

Current version: 0.1

This SDK provides an API with which to allow your Windows-based Point-of-Sale (POS) system to interface with a CloverÂ® Mini device (https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/mini)

The API is currently distributed in three class libraries

1. CloverConnector is the high-level API with methods like `Sale()`, `VoidTransaction()`, `ManualRefund()`, etc.
2. CloverWindowsSDK contains classes that map to standard Clover objects such as `Payment`, `CardTransaction`, `Order`, etc.  These objects will match those defined in [clover-android-sdk|https://github.com/clover/clover-android-sdk] and the objects returned by the [Clover REST API|https://www.clover.com/api_docs]
3. CloverWindowsTransport contains functionality to interface with a Clover Mini device via USB, though this version simulates a Clover device (`CloverTestDevice`) so no connectivity is required.

The libraries currently require .NET 2.0 or higher.

An example project (CloverExamplePOS) is provided to demonstrate how to interact with the APIs.  To open this, please use Visual Studio and open `Clover.sln`

Please report back to us any questions/comments/concerns.  We would love to hear your feedback and we will be publishing additional updates shortly.

Thanks,
The Clover Team
